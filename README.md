# environment_project #

CARS environment project, looking at optical photometry for objects that are physically close to CARS host galaxies.

## Required Catalog Files ##

The Python script 'environments.py' requires the SDSS and GAMA catalog files to be in the same directory as the script itself. The files used in the preliminary analysis can be found here: https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/Data/gal_info_dr7_v5_2.fit.gz for the SDSS catalog (72.4 MB), and http://www.gama-survey.org/dr3/data/cat/SpecLineSFR/v05/GaussFitSimple.fits for the GAMA catalog (195 MB).
