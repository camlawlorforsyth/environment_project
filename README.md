# environment_project #

CARS environment project, looking at optical photometry for objects that are physically close to CARS host galaxies.

## Required Catalog Files ##

The Python script 'environments.py' requires the SDSS and GAMA catalog files to be in the same directory as the script itself. The files used in the preliminary analysis can be found here: http://data.sdss3.org/sas/dr8/common/sdss-spectro/redux/galSpecInfo-dr8.fits for the SDSS DR8 catalog (363 MB), and http://www.gama-survey.org/dr3/data/cat/SpecLineSFR/v05/GaussFitSimple.fits for the GAMA catalog (165 MB).
